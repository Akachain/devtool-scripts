client:
  # Which organization does this application instance belong to? The value must be the name of an org
  # defined under "organizations"
  organization: ORGNAME

  # Some SDKs support pluggable KV stores, the properties under "credentialStore"
  # are implementation specific
  credentialStore:
    path: "/shared/crypto-path/fabric-client-kv-ORGNAME"

    # [Optional]. Specific to the CryptoSuite implementation. Software-based implementations like
    # CryptoSuite_ECDSA_AES.js in node SDK requires a key store. PKCS#11 based implementations does
    # not.
